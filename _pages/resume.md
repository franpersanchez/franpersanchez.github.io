Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

<p style="text-align:justify">
I'm Fran, a Spanish software developer based in the <del>very</del> warm and <del>very</del> sunny south of Spain.

I transitioned from a previous engineering career to software engineering in 2022. Since then, Iâ€™ve been working in the tech industry, currently at <a target="_blank" href="https://telefonicatech.com/">TelefÃ³nica Tech</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
I love programming and enjoy collaborating with others to build innovative and high-quality products. I constantly assign myself small-scale projects to sharpen my skills and explore new technologies.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
These days, also I work with Java, my personal insterest lies in unveiling the entanglements of low-level topics, particularly working with languages like Go and C (yes, C!), <mark class="mark">performance optimization</mark>, <mark class="mark">database engineering</mark>, <mark class="mark">distributed systems</mark>, and applying all this to <mark class="mark">data-intensive applications</mark>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
This is my personal web page, a humble corner in the vast ocean of internet. I'll be updating it with projects, my CV and technical notes on topics that interest me.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
This blog is powered by Jekyll, a simple static site generator in Ruby that keeps things lightweight. Jekyll renders Markdown files and Liquid templates, and then spits out a complete, static website ready to be hosted on Github Pages. The theme used is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes</a>.</p>

* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Higher Technician in Development of web Applications</span> from [CESUR](https://www.cesurformacion.com/). This official two-year course provided me with a solid foundation in software development and ignited my passion for the field.
* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bachelor's Degree in Agricultural Engineering</span> from the [University of Sevilla](https://www.us.es/). This is my former career from which I pivoted to tech industry due to a lack of technical challenges and motivation in my daily work.
