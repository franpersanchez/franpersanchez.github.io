Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

<p style="text-align:justify">
I'm Fran, a software developer based in the <del>very</del> warm and <del>very</del> sunny south of Spain.

I transitioned from a previous engineering career to software engineering back in 2022. Since then, Iâ€™ve been working in the tech industry, currently at <a target="_blank" href="https://telefonicatech.com/">TelefÃ³nica Tech</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Iâ€™m passionate about programming and love collaborating to build innovative, high-quality products. To stay sharp and explore new technologies, I frequently take on small-scale projects.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
While I currently work primarily with Java, my personal interests lie in low-level topics such as <mark class="mark">performance optimization</mark>, <mark class="mark">database engineering</mark>, <mark class="mark">distributed systems</mark> and languages like Go and C (yes, C!). I enjoy applying this knowledge to <mark class="mark">data-intensive</mark> applications.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
This is my personal web page, a humble corner in the vast ocean of internet. I'll be updating it with my projects, CV and technical notes on topics that interest me.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
This blog is powered by Jekyll, a simple static site generator in Ruby that keeps things lightweight. Jekyll renders Markdown files and Liquid templates, and then spits out a complete, static website ready to be hosted on Github Pages. The theme used is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes">Minimal Mistakes</a>.</p>

## I studied here
* Currently pursuing a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science </span> from the [National University of Distance Education](https://www.uned.es/universidad/inicio/en/)(UNED), taking advantage of the flexibility offered by async learning to balance studies with work and personal life.

* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Higher Technician in Development of web Applications</span> from [CESUR](https://www.cesurformacion.com/), a two-year course that built my foundation in software development and ignited my passion for the field.

* <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bachelor's Degree in Agricultural Engineering</span> from the [University of Sevilla](https://www.us.es/). This was my previous career before pivoting to tech due to a lack of technical challenges and motivation in my daily work.
